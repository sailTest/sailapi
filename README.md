Code test for SailPoint.


Objective: 

Use the GitHub API to retrieve a summary of all opened, closed, and in progress pull requests in the last
week for a given repository and print an email summary report that might be sent to a manager or Scrum-master.


Language of choice: Python

Please print to console the details of the email you would send (From, To, Subject, Body). As part of the submission, you are welcome to create a Dockerfile to build an image that will run the program, however, other ways of implementing this is acceptable.

Your code prints a user-friendly summary of
open, 
merged,  
closed 
pull requests including counts of PRs as well as their titles. Use your judgement on what you think is important information.
